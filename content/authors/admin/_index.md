Kakei Yamamoto is a first-year Ph.D. student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) under the supervision of Professor Martin Wainwright and Professor Sasha Rakhlin. I am also affiliated to the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS).
Prior to MIT, I graduated in 2023 from the University of Tokyo (UTokyo) with a Bachelors of Engineering in Mathematical Informatics where I performed research on optimization for reinforcement learning in the Department of Applied Mathematics under Prof. Taiji Suzuki.
